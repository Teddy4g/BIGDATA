## Overview

**BIGDATA** is a final-year undergraduate thesis project focused on integrating **Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI)** with **LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)** networks to forecast stock prices. This project leverages **SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations)** to provide interpretable insights, enabling users to understand and trust the predictions generated by deep learning models.

## Why BIGDATA?

While LSTM models offer strong performance for time series forecasting, their black-box nature makes them hard to interpret. By incorporating SHAP, this project helps uncover **feature importance** and **temporal influences**, offering transparency in the decision-making process.

### Key Features:

- LSTM-based model for time-series stock price prediction  
- SHAP visualizations for explainability  
- Built in **Python 3.9.6** for compatibility  
- Uses **Conda virtual environment** for environment isolation and dependency management  
- Interactive development in **Jupyter Notebook**

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed:

- [Miniconda or Anaconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html)
- Git

> ⚠️ **Note:** This project must be run on **Python 3.9.6**.  
> It is **not compatible** with newer versions of Python due to dependency conflicts with SHAP and TensorFlow.

### Installation

Follow these steps to set up the project:

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Teddy4g/BIGDATA
   cd BIGDATA
2. **Create and activate Conda Environment**
   ```bash
   conda create -n bigdata-env python=3.9.6
   conda activate bigdata-env
